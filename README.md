Here i am trying to explore vector databases specially embeddings.

**What Are Vectors?**
n mathematics, vectors are entities characterized by an ordered set of numbers, known as components, which define their position within a vector space.

A straightforward example is a vector in a two-dimensional space, represented by its coordinates 
(x,y).

**What Is Text Embedding?**
Embeddings are numerical representations of those tokens, encoding relationships between any data tokens (units of data), where a data token can be an image, sound recording, text, or video frame.

**Vector Database** - A vector database is a data storage system where each item is represented as a numerical vector. These vectors capture the essence of objects or entities, such as images, people, or places, in an abstract N-dimensional space.
  They are special types of databases that store embeddings (vectors).
